# Course Scheduler
Program that helps students create their ideal course schedule, based on user preferences and timing. 
How to use the Course Scheduler?

1.	Select your preferences: 
    a.	Are you a morning or afternoon person?  
    b.	What distribution requirement do you need to fulfil?
    c.	You may leave either field blank if you do not have preferences

2.	Add between 5-10 courses into the scheduler. For each course type:
    a.	Name of the course, e.g. “CS230”
    b.	How you rank the course. You may enter any positive integer, where a higher integer indicates greater interest in the course.
    c.	Click “Add Course” once you have entered this information for each course, and repeat.
    d.	You may see which courses you have entered under “Courses Added”
    e.	At any point you may click “Clear” under “Courses Added” to start over and re-enter all your courses. 
    
3.	Once you have entered your desired number of courses, click “Generate Plan!”

4.	A schedule consisting of 4 courses will appear under “Schedule”. Based on your preferences, you should take these 4 courses next semester!

5.	If you have changed your mind about a course, you may click “Start Over” under “Add a Course” and try entering in courses again.
